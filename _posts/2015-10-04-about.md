I am heavily involved with site performance, automation, monitoring and infrastructure at [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com).

Prior to Tumblr, I worked in a variety of roles building, supporting and scaling systems in the [ecommerce](https://www.groupon.com/occasion/ideel), [agribusiness](https://www.bunge.com/), [internet hosting](https://www.contegix.com/) and [healthcare](https://twitter.com/cerner) industries.
