I am heavily involved with site performance, automation, monitoring and all things related to edge infrastructure at [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com).

Prior to Tumblr, I worked in a variety of roles building, supporting and scaling systems in the [ecommerce](http://www.ideel.com), [agribusiness](http://www.bunge.com/), [internet hosting](http://www.contegix.com/) and [healthcare](https://twitter.com/cerner) industries.
