![Gazing at the Mediterranean from Acre, Israel](http://www.joelsmiller.com/assets/images/jsm_acre.jpg) 
I am heavily involved with site performance, automation, monitoring and all things related to infrastructure at [Ideel](http://www.ideel.com).

Prior to Ideel, I worked in a variety of roles building, supporting and scaling systems in the [agribusiness](http://www.bunge.com/), [internet hosting](http://www.contegix.com/) and [healthcare](http://www.cerner.com/) industries.
